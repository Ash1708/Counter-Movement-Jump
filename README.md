Biomechanical Analysis of counter movement jump with Load

Research Question: To quantify the effect that barbell load has on kinetic variables during counter movement jump. 

Participant: One individual (age 26, mass 80kg and height 176cm) volunteered to participate in the experiment. The subject had at least 1 year of resistance training experience and was participating in a structured strength and conditioning program as part of the ongoing personal training.

Data processing: All the component of the ground reaction force was recorded by software. Three trials of each CMJ were performed and the jump with best height was analyzed. The variables analyzed during this 
experiment are Jump height, Propulsion and Landing Impulse, Average force generation during propulsion and landing phases, Propulsion and Landing duration. Data acquisition and analysis of the 
jumps were performed using Excel. Impulse momentum method is used to calculate the jump height and other mentioned parameters. Graphs were plotted for the comparison and assessment of 
kinetic variables

Result: 
Jump Height Decreases with Increased Load:
As load increased, jump height consistently decreased, following a proportional pattern.

Increase in Propulsion and Landing Impulse:
Propulsion impulse increased slightly with each added load, leading to a decrease in average net force and an increase in propulsion duration.
Landing impulse increased, but the reduction in average net force was outweighed by the longer landing time.

Mechanical Consequences of Incremental Loading:
The longer force application duration suggests that incrementally loaded jumps do not inherently increase injury risk but may alter movement strategies.
Increased hip and knee flexion could be a compensatory mechanism to absorb greater forces during landing.

Training and Practical Implications:
From a strength and conditioning perspective, monitoring an athleteâ€™s ability to jump higher in less time with the same load could indicate improved force application capacity.
Practitioners using incremental loading protocols should closely observe landing strategies to mitigate potential injury risks.
